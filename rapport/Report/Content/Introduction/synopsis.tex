In this project, We report on research on making it easier for using a GPU, by using a spreadsheet program as a medium for coding to it. Before the coding of this functionality for a program. a test with matrix multiplication have conducted to see what GPU library best could work in the scope of this project.
The libraries that have been testes are: CUDA, C++ AMP and CUDAfy. it was chosen to make a GPU function using CUDAfy, since it showed promise in the tests and also the open source spreadsheet program that was used, \textit{Corecalc and Funcalc} was made in c\# and CUDAfy was design to be used in that programming language.
There have been conducted a test to see if this new GPU function showed that it coud be useful time wise and these tests showed if the expression that is being calculated is large enough.
