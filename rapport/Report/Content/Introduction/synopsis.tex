In this project, there have been conducted research on if it is possible for making it easier for programming to a GPU by using a spreadsheet program as a medium for coding to it. Before the coding of this functionality for a program. a test with matrix multiplication have conducted to see what GPU library best could work in the scope of this project.
The libraries that have been testes are: CUDA, C++ AMP and CUDAfy. it was chosen to make a GPU function using CUDAfy, since it showed promise in the tests and also the open source spreadsheet program that was used, \textit{Corecalc and Funcalc} was made in c\# and CUDAfy was design to be used in that programming language.
There have been conducted a test to see if this new GPU function on the could be useful time wise and the test showed if the expression that is being calculated is large enough or there is a large amount of data for the expression it could benefit from being calculated on the GPU.
